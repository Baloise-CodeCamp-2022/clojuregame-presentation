= Codecamp 2022: Clojure

Functional Programming with an unknown language

//:title-slide-background-color: #ff0000

== Motivation

[%step]
* improve functional programming skills
* use a unknown language which is hyped by some people

=== Codecamp Goals
[%step]
* Understand the pros and cons of the programming language
* Understand the FP way of clojure compared to other languages (Haskell, Scala)
* Apply clean architecture
* Prod-first
* "Real" application with web ui and persistence
* Apply TDD

== Intro to clojure
// Peter
* Syntax
* REPL

== Infrastructure
// Renat
- CI
- openshift
- Hello world
- People REST API

== TicTacToe
// Sven
- Demo

== Sudoku
// Peter
- Demo

=== Learning Curve

- (lots of parentheses )
- A single week was not enough

=== Developer experience

Renat:

- it is possible to code in a 'procedural' style (tictactoe/core/makeMove)
- Cursive plugin in intellij: inconvenient bc. it is opinionated on what can be typed

Sven:

- No Types (Either...)
- Errorhandling

Peter:

- REPL
- Clojuredocs
